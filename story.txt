  Babe Scarlett was born in a family filled with love. She liked looking at the stars in the sky. The stars told her stories every night after her mom and dad fell asleep.

Babe loved to watch the stars dance and glitter, but sometimes she swore she could see them move.  The Little Dipper would scoop the sky, Ursa Major and Minor could be found wrestling in the dark void above.  Even the North Star would dart about, leaving many sailors confused she thought.
